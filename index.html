                            In recent months, large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have received
                            widespread attention from the whole society, and the breakthrough has significantly promoted
                            the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While new technologies bring many
                            new application scenarios, we must carefully consider how the LLMs affect the people who use
                            it and are impacted by it.
